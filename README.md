# SSPROP-NFOL-Examples
Example files that illustrates the use of SSPROP-NFOL project (https://github.com/TerenceWSK/SSPROP-NFOL).

# Description
The example files in this directory illustrate how to use SSPROP-NFOL to simulate linear and nonlinear propagation in fiber.  
The examples reproduce many of the numerical results that are presented in Chapter 3 to Chapter 5 in Govind. P. Agrawal's book, "Nonlinear Fiber Optics", 5th Edition.

It is recommended that you add the root directory in addition to the main SSPROP-NFOL directory to your Matlab path before running the examples.
